# Flag Predictor – Live Forecasts

10-day ensemble forecasts of river height differential (related to the flow speed) for the Isis, Godstow, and Wallingford stretches. The river is most likely to follow the purple (mean) trajectory, but we could end up on any of the blue ones depending on how much rain we actually get. Plots update automatically every hour, with new rainfall forecasts incorporated every 6 hours as they are released by ECMWF.
